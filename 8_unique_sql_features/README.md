# Unique SQL Features

This folder contains examples related to specialized SQL features including recursive queries, geospatial data queries, and graph queries.

## Example File
- [unique_sql_features.sql](unique_sql_features.sql) - Examples of specialized SQL features

## Topics Covered

### Recursive Queries (WITH RECURSIVE)
- Hierarchical data traversal
- Tree and graph structure navigation
- Self-referential relationships
- Generating series and sequences

### Geospatial Data Queries
- Spatial data types (POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON)
- Distance calculations (ST_Distance)
- Spatial relationships (ST_Contains, ST_Intersects)
- Spatial indexing and optimization

### Graph Queries
- Property graph models
- Path finding algorithms
- Graph traversal and pattern matching
- Relationship analysis

## Database System Variations
- PostgreSQL: PostGIS extension, recursive CTEs
- Oracle: Spatial and Graph, CONNECT BY
- SQL Server: Spatial data types, recursive CTEs
- MySQL: Spatial extensions, recursive CTEs (8.0+)

## Practical Applications
- Organization hierarchies
- File system navigation
- Location-based services
- Social network analysis
- Route planning and optimization
- Recommendation systems

## How to Use
1. Study the example file to understand specialized SQL features
2. Experiment with recursive queries for hierarchical data
3. Try geospatial queries if you have access to spatial data
4. Explore graph queries for relationship analysis

## Note
This topic doesn't have specific problems from the problem set, as these specialized features are often used in specific domains rather than general SQL challenges. However, understanding these concepts can be valuable for solving complex real-world problems that involve hierarchies, spatial relationships, or network structures.
