   - 15 practice problems on aggregation, sorting, and grouping

8. **[8_unique_sql_features](8_unique_sql_features/)**
   - Recursive Queries
   - Geospatial Data Queries
   - Graph Queries

## Master Query

All examples are derived from a comprehensive master query (`master_query.sql`) that demonstrates many SQL features in a single file. This master query serves as a reference for how different SQL features can be combined in complex queries.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with folder 1 and work your way through in numerical order
2. Each folder contains:
   - A README.md file explaining the topic and listing relevant problems
   - An SQL file with examples of the topic's features
   - (In some folders) Problem descriptions and solutions
3. Study the example file in each folder to understand the concepts
4. Work through the practice problems to reinforce your learning
5. Refer back to the master query to see how different features can be combined

## Database Compatibility

The examples include syntax variations for different database systems where appropriate:
- MySQL/MariaDB
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- SQL Server

Note that not all features are available in all database systems, and syntax may vary.

## Learning Path

This repository is designed to take you from basic SQL queries to advanced database concepts. By working through the folders in order, you'll build a solid foundation in SQL and gradually tackle more complex topics.

Happy learning! # sql
