# Transactions and Concurrency

This folder contains examples related to SQL transaction control and concurrency management, including transaction blocks, row locking, and isolation levels.

## Example File
- [transactions_and_concurrency.sql](transactions_and_concurrency.sql) - Examples of transaction control and concurrency management

## Topics Covered

### Transaction Control
- BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, ROLLBACK
- Transaction blocks
- Atomic operations
- Error handling in transactions

### Row Locking
- FOR UPDATE clause
- LOCK IN SHARE MODE
- Preventing concurrent modifications
- Deadlock prevention

### Concurrency Control
- Transaction isolation levels
  - SERIALIZABLE
  - READ COMMITTED
  - READ UNCOMMITTED
  - REPEATABLE READ
- Preventing concurrency issues:
  - Dirty reads
  - Non-repeatable reads
  - Phantom reads

## Practical Applications
- Financial transactions
- Inventory management
- User account operations
- Data migration processes

## How to Use
1. Study the example file to understand transaction control and concurrency concepts
2. Experiment with different isolation levels to observe their effects
3. Practice implementing proper error handling in transactions
4. Learn to identify and prevent deadlock situations

## Note
This topic doesn't have specific problems from the problem set, as transaction control is typically part of application development rather than isolated query challenges. However, understanding these concepts is crucial for building robust database applications.
